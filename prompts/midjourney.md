### Capa:

Design a visually striking cover art that embodies the concept of version control and Git. The image should depict a tree-like structure with multiple branches, each glowing in different colors to represent code branches and merges. The background should be a gradient of dark tones (black, deep blue) to contrast with the vibrant branches. Add subtle digital effects, such as pixelated glows or holographic textures, to give a tech-inspired vibe. Ensure the composition is balanced and dynamic, avoiding any text or characters, and emphasizing the power and organization of Git.
